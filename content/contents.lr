I'm Darian, a lead product developer based in South London who enjoys building out software, teams & the culture required to make successful businesses.

Right now, I'm particularly interested in functional programming, distributed systems, observability, security and the emerging serverless landscape.

Since 2008, I've worked with firms of all shapes & sizes: one man bands, small & large agencies, software houses, start-ups & enterprises. For a more detailed work history, please see [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/darianmoody).

Outside of tech I'm a keen traveller, [F1](https://www.formula1.com/) head, supporter of sound system culture and a life long follower of the [drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFW_drkLw9A) [&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4imUOY-wZw) [bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkV4TXZcMTg) scene.
